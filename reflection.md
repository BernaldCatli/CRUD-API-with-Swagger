API documentation is essential in real-world projects because it serves as the blueprint for how developers interact with a system, enabling seamless integration, faster development, and fewer errors. It provides clear instructions on endpoints, data formats, authentication, and error handling, which helps teams collaborate efficiently and onboard new developers quickly. Well-maintained documentation also ensures long-term scalability and maintainability, allowing systems to evolve without breaking existing functionality. Ultimately, it transforms an API from a black box into a reliable, user-friendly tool that accelerates innovation and adoption.
